    // vector was introduced in jdk 1 before the collection framewoks
    // it is part of lagecy class later it was added into collections framework as implementation class of List interface.

    // It is sychronized type of array which provides thread safety in multi-threaded environment.
    // constructors : 
    // 1. Vector() -> basic create vector with defacult capacity
    // 2. Vector(int initalCapacity) -> basic create vector with given initial capacity
    // 3. Vector(int initalCapacity, int capacityIncrement) -> basic create vector with given initial capacity, and capacityIncrement 
    // 4. Vector(Collection<? extends E> c) -> creates the vector with passed collections like ArrayList and LinekdList.
